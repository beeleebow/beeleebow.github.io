<p>I am a Software Developer/Engineer who never knows whether to call himself a Developer or Engineer. Engineer sounds better, so let’s go with Developer.</p>
<p>I live in Brisbane, Australia, where I work for <a href="https://stacktracehq.com">Stacktrace</a>. My current day-to-day is working with C#/dotnet and Angular, deployed on Azure. I have mixed feelings about this.</p>
<p>I have built software for several industries, using a slew of languages, frameworks, and tools. To the extent that I can enjoy things, I enjoy building useful software as simply as possible. In my experience this is unreasonably hard to do. If you have magic beans, I will buy them. Something, something, Mircoservices.</p>
<p>I’ve gone on a functional programming journey in the past couple of years. I believed I was reaching a summit of sorts, but apparently I’m still in my driveway, at the bottom of a hill, beneath a bus stop where I can catch a bus to the airport and get a plane to where the mountain actually is. I miss my family.</p>
<p>If you must, you can find me on:</p>

<li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/brad-bow-0b337a35/">LinkedIn</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I’m not on Twitter or Facebook and am generally weary of people, places, and things.</p>
