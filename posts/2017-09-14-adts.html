<div class="tldr">
<p><strong>Algebraic data types (ADTs)</strong> are types that are created from combining <strong>sum</strong> and <strong>product</strong> types.</p>
<p>Sum types are inhabited by a distinct set of alternate values (think enumerations) and product types are inhabited by all the possible combinations of the composite parts (think tuples, records, or structs).</p>
<p>While these concepts are relevant in all programming languages and paradigms, ADTs hold a central place in functional programming and are represented elegantly in Haskell.</p>

<h2 id="hey-that-sounds-like-math">Hey! That sounds like Math!</h2>
<p>If you’re a programmer you are probably fine with the “Data Types” part. You may even be fine with the “Rethinking” part. The “Algebraically” part might have you running for the hills though. I don’t know why. They have math in the hills. They aren’t animals.</p>
<p>Anyway, you needn’t fear, there will be precious little math in this post. All we really need is a basic understanding of an <strong>algebra</strong>. This is convenient because a basic understanding is all I have.</p>
<p>For the purposes of this post:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An algebra consists of a set of <strong>objects</strong> along with a set of <strong>operations on those objects</strong>. In an algebra we build new objects by passing existing objects to the operations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For example, we could form an algebra where our objects are integers and our operations are addition and multiplication. We can get the integer 3 by passing 2 and 1 to the addition operation, i.e. <code class="language-haskell">3 = 2 + 1</code>. We can get the integer 16 by passing 2 and 8 to the multiplication operation, i.e. <code class="language-haskell">16 = 2 * 8</code>.</p>
<p>Not that scary after all, right?</p>
<h2 id="example-time">Example Time!</h2>
<p>Here is some Haskell.</p>
<pre><code class="language-haskell">data Department = Engineering | Marketing | Research
data EmployeeClassification = FullTime | PartTime

-- John Smith is an full time employee,
-- working in the Engineering department
johnSmith :: (Department, EmployeeClassification)
johnSmith = (Engineering, FullTime)
</code></pre>
<p>For the uninitiated, here is a basic overview:</p>
<ul>
<li>We define two types, <code class="language-haskell">Department</code> and <code class="language-haskell">EmployeeClassification</code>, which can each be constructed by using one of a choice of <strong>data constructors</strong>. In this case the data constructors are all parameter-less, effectively making these types enumerations.</li>
<li>We declare a <code class="language-haskell">(Department, EmployeeClassification)</code> tuple, which represents a full time employee that works in the Engineering department.</li>
</ul>
<p>With that basic explanation out of the way, let’s ask ourselves a few questions.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>How many inhabitants (i.e. distinct values) of the <code class="language-haskell">Department</code> type are there?</li>
<li>How many inhabitants of the <code class="language-haskell">EmployeeClassification</code> type are there?</li>
<li>How many inhabitants of the <code class="language-haskell">(Department, EmployeeClassification)</code> type are there? That is, how many combinations of <code class="language-haskell">Department</code> and <code class="language-haskell">EmployeeClassification</code> exist?</li>
</ol>
<p>Questions 1 and 2 are easy enough to answer. We can just count the number of data constructors. Put another way, replace every data constructor with a 1, then <strong>sum</strong> the ones. So for the <code class="language-haskell">Department</code> type we have <code class="language-haskell">Engineering | Marketing | Research ==&gt; 1 + 1 + 1 = 3</code>. Similarly, for the <code class="language-haskell">EmployeeClassification</code> type we have <code class="language-haskell">FullTime | PartTime ==&gt; 1 + 1 = 2</code>.</p>
<p>Question 3 requires a little bit of work to answer. We can enumerate all the options by hand (see below) <em>or</em> we can dust off that set theory textbook and recognize this as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_product">cartesian <strong>product</strong></a> (or cross join in SQL parlance). That textbook would tell us that the cartesian product of a set that contains 3 elements (our <code class="language-haskell">Department</code> type) and a set that contains 2 elements (our <code class="language-haskell">EmployeeClassification</code> type), is 3 x 2 = 6, which matches what we get via our brute force method applied below.</p>
<pre><code class="language-haskell">(Engineering, FullTime)
(Engineering, PartTime)
(Marketing, FullTime)
(Marketing, PartTime)
(Research, FullTime)
(Research, PartTime)
</code></pre>
<p>We have mentioned <strong>sums</strong> and <strong>products</strong>. They sure do sound like things that might be involved in algebra…</p>
<h2 id="so-where-is-the-algebra">So, where is the algebra?</h2>
<p>We said that an algebra is the combination of a set of objects and a set of operations that operate on those objects. So how does this relate to <strong>Algebraic</strong> Data Types?</p>
<p>Let’s say that the objects in our algebra are <strong>types</strong>. What would our operations be? That is, how do we build <em>new</em> types from existing types? Well, we saw two ways of doing that.</p>
<p>Firstly, we can define a type as something constructed by one of an alternate set of data constructors, e.g. <code class="language-haskell">data Department = Engineering | Marketing | Research</code>. We also made the observation that the cardinality of this set can be calculated via a <strong>sum</strong> operation, i.e. counting the constructors. So, we could say that one of the operations that allow us to make new types is a “sum operation”, where the inhabitants of the new type are made up from the union of the alternate choices. Types constructed from sum operations are called <strong>sum types</strong>.</p>
<p>Secondly, we saw that we can define a new type by <em>combining</em> other types, e.g. our <code class="language-haskell">(Department, EmployeeClassification)</code> tuple. The inhabitants of this type are enumerated by applying a <strong>product operation</strong> (the cartesian product in set-theoretic terms) to the composite types. So, we could say that we were able to make a new type via the use of a “product operation”. Types constructed from product operations are called <strong>product types</strong>.</p>
<p>In glorious conclusion, when we talk about Algebraic Data Types what we are referring to are composite types that are built from a combination of sum and product operations. Simples … right?</p>
