        <h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>
<div class="tldr">
<p>We typically build programs out of a mix of <strong>expressions</strong> and <strong>statements</strong>. Expressions can be <strong>evaluated</strong> to produce a value, e.g. <code class="language-csharp">5 + 7</code> produces <code class="language-csharp">12</code>. Statements do not produce values, they exist to have some effect (or side-effect), e.g. <code class="language-csharp">Console.Write(“I am a statement.”)</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Preferring expressions over statements</strong> will result in code that is easier to reason about.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="so-whats-the-difference">So what’s the difference?</h2>
<p>An <strong>expression</strong> is a composition of values and sub-expressions which, upon <em>evaluation</em>, reduce to a single value. Let’s take some simple mathematical examples.</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">5 + 7
3 * (4 - 1)
7*x + 5
</code></pre>
<p>Example 1 is an expression that requires a single evaluation to produce a value, in this case <code class="language-csharp">12</code>. The second example requires two evaulations. First, we evaluate <code class="language-csharp">4 - 1</code>, then we multiply that value with <code class="language-csharp">3</code>. We see a <em>parameterised</em> expression in example 3. Given a value for <code class="language-csharp">x</code> (the parameter) we can evaluate <code class="language-csharp">7 * x</code> then add <code class="language-csharp">5</code> to this value (1 substitution, followed by 2 evaluations).</p>
<p>A <strong>statement</strong>, on the other hand, does not produce a value. It is an imperative instruction to the machine to do something. Let’s have a look at some familiar statements.</p>
<pre id="ex1"><code class="language-csharp">Console.WriteLine("I am a statement");

_logger.Info("I am a side-effect. Boo!");

var firstInteger = -1;
if(_listOfIntegers.Length > 0){
  firstInteger = _listOfIntegers[0];
}
</code></pre>
<p>Writing to the Console or logging are statements because you don’t get values back from running them. The <code class="language-csharp">if</code> construct in most languages executes blocks of statements if a certain predicate (i.e. an <em>expression</em> that evaluates to a <code class="language-csharp">bool</code>) is true.</p>
<h2 id="whats-the-problem">What’s the problem?</h2>
<p>In most programming languages, the functions – probably more accurately called methods – end up mixing expressions and statements. Consider the following C# code.</p>
<pre id="ex1"><code class="language-csharp">public int PureAdd(int x, int y)
{
  return x + y;
}

public int ImpureAdd(int x, int y)
{
  Console.WriteLine($"Adding {x} and {y}");
  return x + y;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Invocations of <code class="language-csharp">PureAdd</code> and <code class="language-csharp">ImpureAdd</code> both produce values. Evaluation of <code class="language-csharp">ImpureAdd</code>, however, also produces the side effect of writing a message to the console. The effect is achieved by calling the <code>Console.WriteLine</code> method, which we can think of as a statement, since it doens’t return a value.</p>
<p>Now let’s imagine that we, correctly, realise that having our own method for adding two <code>int</code> values is silly and decide to replace any usage of our method with the built in <code>+</code> operator. To rectify this, we’ll just do a regex-based find and replace across all our source files.</p>
<p>If we’ve used <code>PureAdd</code> then our regex would replace <code>PureAdd(x, y)</code> with <code>x + y</code>. When we run our program after this change, nothing will actually be different. We won’t produce any new output, or change the results in any way.</p>
<p>However, if we’ve used <code>ImpureAdd</code> then our regex would replace <code>ImpureAdd(x, y)</code> with <code>x + y</code>. This will result in the same produced value, but we would have changed our program’s output. The program that called <code>ImpureAdd(x, y)</code> would have been producing console output, because of the <code>Console.WriteLine</code>. The program that inlines <code>x + y</code> will not produce this output. By making what seems to be a like-for-like substitution, we’ve actually changed the behaviour or our running program.</p>
<p>We’ve all worked on code bases that seem to get harder and harder to change over time. This is due, in large part, to an accumlation of hard-to-discover side-effects. I change code over here, and now code over here is broken. One of the main causes of this state of affairs is the over-use of statements, because statements are <strong>always side-effecting</strong> (except for silly examples like empty <code>if</code> blocks). Think about it. How can you possibly have a statement that doesn’t have a side effect? It has to do <em>something</em>, and it doesn’t produce a value.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As an aside, a <em>pure</em> functional programming language is one that has only expressions, no statements (and therefore no side-effects).</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="whats-the-take-away">What’s the take away?</h2>
<p>Try to build as much of your program as you can out of pure expressions and limit the use of statements. Here are a few tips:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Don’t write <code class="language-csharp">void</code> methods/functions.</strong> A method/function that doesn’t return anything is just another statement. Your programming language probably has enough of those already. You don’t need to be adding more.</li>
<li><strong>Side effects at the edges, pure in the middle</strong> The reality is that your program needs to perform side effects to be useful. At some point you’ll need to read from a database or write to a response stream. Don’t let these concerns pollute your entire program. Fence them off as soon as you can and keep those side effects out or your pure application logic.</li>
<li><strong>Avoid mutation.</strong> Mutation destroys determinism. That is, you can’t expect the same output for the same inputs every time if things are being changed along the way.</li>
<li><strong>Replace control flow structures and error handling with type driven alternatives.</strong> Instead of having a <code class="language-csharp">Person</code> object that can be null, represent the nullability in a type, e.g. <code class="language-csharp">Option<Person></code>. Instead of throwing an exception, represent that an evaluation might fail in a type, e.g. <code class="language-csharp">Either&lt;Exception, Person&gt;</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Go forth and express yourself.</p>
