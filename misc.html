            <p>I didn’t want a menu with more than three items in it, so I’m going to put everything else here. Don’t worry, I’ll use headings.</p>
<h2 id="pluralsight">Pluralsight</h2>
<p>I upped my Git game a couple of years ago and helped a few colleagues to do the same. In doing so I discovered an enjoyment for teaching and story-telling. I also have a general fondness for money. I brought these two things together and authored a <a href="https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/rewriting-git-history/table-of-contents">Pluralsight course on Rewriting Git History</a>.</p>
<p>I’m considering authoring another course in the near future.</p>
<h2 id="functional-programming-adventures">Functional Programming Adventures</h2>
<p>I’ve been diving into the big wide world of FP (that’s Functional Programming speak for Functional Programming). I still have quite a way to go, but here are some projects/courses I’ve done and can recommend.</p>
<div class="callout">
<p><a href="https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis194/spring13/lectures.html">CIS194 Course</a></p>
<p>This is a course taught by Brent Yorgey at the University of Pennsylvania. It pretty much starts from scratch and gets you up to Monads. Some colleagues and I put together a <a href="https://github.com/stacktracehq/cis194-exercises">GitHub repository</a> that contains unit tests for each of the weekly homework assignments, so you can TDD your way to victory.</p>
</div>
<div class="callout">
<p><a href="https://github.com/data61/fp-course">Data61/QFPL Intro Course</a></p>
<p>This is a set of exercises that use Haskell to teach core functional programming concepts. It serves as the content for a 3-day Introduction to Functional Programming workshop run by the <a href="https://qfpl.io">Queensland Functional Programming Lab</a> (QFPL), which I can highly recommend.</p>
</div>
<div class="callout">
<p><a href="https://github.com/qfpl/applied-fp-course">Data61/QFPL Applied Course</a></p>
<p>This repository backs another 3-day workshop run by the QFPL. It builds on the topics covered in the introductory course and guides you through building a real web-service, which encodes/decodes JSON and talks to a SQL database.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="books">Books</h2>
<p>I’d love to say I’ve read The Blue Book, or Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs. But I haven’t, OK? I probably never will. And, yes, I know I should.</p>
<p>I’m currently reading:</p>
